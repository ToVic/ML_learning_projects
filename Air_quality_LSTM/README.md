Relative humidity prediction using Bidirecitonal LSTM within Tensorflow. The data is from UCI ML repository and the source is linked in the notebooks.
Basic learning rate scheduling was used when training the model.

The project is left unfinished while I study more about the RNNs and multi-step predictions.
