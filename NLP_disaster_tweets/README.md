Kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started/overview

Best model so far: RNN (LSTM)

Best public score: 0.79 something

I tried an alternative approach to this problem using not only RNN but also a CNN (it actually makes sense if you think about it)

Even though NLP is not my point of interest, I found this project addictive and fun
