# ML_learning_projects
ML miniprojects

In this repository you can find all the Data Science projects I have worked on, including projects from tutorials and lectures. 
In the courses file, none of the notebooks is my own work. I was just following steps, hints or workflows of other authors, I take no credit for those.
All the other projects represent my own free time studying effort or school projects.
