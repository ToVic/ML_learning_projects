ML miniprojects

Projects I went through while learning more about DS/ML. School projects also included. Any inspiration taken is cited/linked in the corresponding directories/notebooks.

NOTE: The LSTM projects lack multistep predictions, I will come back to them later once I understand RNNs better.
