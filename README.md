# ML_learning_projects
ML miniprojects

In this repository you can find all the Data Science projects I have worked on, including projects from tutorials and lectures. 

In the courses file, none of the notebooks is purely my own work. I was just following steps, hints or workflows of other authors, I take no credit for those.

The remaining are my own projects, projects which I successfully finished within my university studies and mostly stuff I have been tuning in my free time.
Occasionally, you can find some Kaggle competitions and corresponding projects, including the famous Titanic). I did not tune either of those models in the titanic folder
and they are NOT good.
