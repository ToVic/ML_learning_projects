Trying out Google Colab GPU capabilities using a CNN for basic image recognition performed on the CIFAR10 dataset. 

As image recognition is not my primary interest, I was not tweaking the hyperparameters, I just wanted to perform an introductory task using the internet and my current TF knowledge.
Also I decided to use the functional API instead of my usual layer listing approach.
I am planning to create more sophisticated models using CNNs in the future. This is a good start.
