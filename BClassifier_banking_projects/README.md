This is a school project for the subject 4IZ4480 at the Faculty of Informatics and Statistics at the Prague University of Economics.

Beta-version of the code and final improvements are my work, s/o to Jachym Dvorak for making the code comprehensive and fixing some issues.

The markdown is, unfortunately, for the purpose of actually passing the subject (:D) written in czech. 

THE ACTUAL PROJECT and its final version can be found within the TimeDeposit_v6 notebook.
The BankingPrediction notebook is a beta version on another dataset, which was not turned in eventually.
