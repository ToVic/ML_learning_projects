USED DATASET: https://www.kaggle.com/benpowis/customer-propensity-to-purchase-data?select=training_sample.csv

Within this project I used a simple multi-layer NN to predict whether a customer will or will not order from a website. The data represent sequential steps
within the website's environment, thus this project is not quite a classical propensity project with clients-related data. In the corresponding notebooks I 
created a simple model (model_1), then decided to create a module with four frequently used functions, which I then used to perform a very basic 
demonstration of hyperparams tuning, balancing and final testing. You can find more details regarding the balancing techniques within the corresponding 
notebook.
